# sqlite-scanner

`sqlite-scanner` is a tiny Go CLI that recurses through one or more directories, checks each regular file’s header bytes, and reports the ones whose first 16 bytes match `SQLite format 3\x00`. It never trusts file extensions, and it can run multiple workers in parallel for speed.

## Features

- scans one or more positional paths or falls back to `.` when no paths are specified
- configurable worker pool via `--workers` (defaults to your CPU count)
- always prints absolute paths so results are unambiguous
- optional `--size` flag that appends file sizes to text output and emits JSON objects like `{"path": "...", "size": ...}`
- newline-delimited JSON via `--jsonl`; use `--size` to include each object's size field
- JSON output mode (`--json`) that pretty-prints `{"entries": [...]}` objects for downstream processing
- streams matches immediately as they’re discovered (plain text and pretty JSON)
- custom `--help` text that describes usage, examples, and notes

## Installation

### Run without installing (Go)

If you have Go installed, you can run it directly without cloning anything:

```bash
go run github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner@latest /path/to/scan
```

### Run without installing (Python)

The package is also [available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sqlite-scanner/). If you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed:

```bash
uvx sqlite-scanner /path/to/scan
```

### Run without installing (Conda)

The package is also [available on conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge/packages/sqlite-scanner). If you have [pixi](https://pixi.sh) installed:

```bash
pixi exec sqlite-scanner /path/to/scan
```

### Install with pip

```bash
pip install sqlite-scanner
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv tool install sqlite-scanner
```

### Install with pixi

```bash
pixi global install sqlite-scanner
```

### Install with Go

```bash
go install github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner@latest
```

### Download a binary

Pre-built binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner/releases).

On macOS, the downloaded binary may be blocked by Gatekeeper. Follow [Apple's instructions for opening apps from unidentified developers](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445) to allow it to run.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonw/sqlite-scanner
cd sqlite-scanner
go build -o sqlite-scanner
```

## Usage

Simple scan (current directory):

```bash
sqlite-scanner
```

Scan `/tmp` and `$HOME`:

```bash
sqlite-scanner /tmp ~
```

Use JSON mode:

```bash
sqlite-scanner /tmp --json
```

Example JSON output shape:

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {"path": "/abs/path/to/db1.sqlite"},
    {"path": "/abs/path/to/db2.sqlite"}
  ]
}
```

Use newline-delimited JSON to stream objects per line (requires `--size` to include size):

```bash
sqlite-scanner --jsonl ~/dev
```

Example JSONL output shape (no size):

```jsonl
{"path": "/abs/path/to/db1.sqlite"}
{"path": "/abs/path/to/db2.sqlite"}
```

Example JSONL output shape (with `--size`):

```jsonl
{"path": "/abs/path/to/db1.sqlite", "size": 12345}
{"path": "/abs/path/to/db2.sqlite", "size": 67890}
```

Include sizes (plain text shows `(size bytes)` and JSON outputs objects) with:

```bash
sqlite-scanner --size /tmp --json
```

Example `--size` output (plain text):

```
/abs/path/to/db1.sqlite (12345 bytes)
/abs/path/to/db2.sqlite (67890 bytes)
```

Check available flags (it prints the detailed help text added earlier; all flags use the `--flag` form):

```bash
sqlite-scanner --help
```

## Testing

```bash
go test
```
